This is a log of the new concepts I had to learn along the way to face the challenges with building the program: 


Challenge 1: (NightMode)

I wanted the program to keep the value of the users nightmode preference, as in if they toggle in it on, then the nighmode will persist even if they log out. 

to achieve this i had to learn how to use express-session. with this i could keep track of the user that logs in and depending on the nigmode value in the sql table i can toggle nightmode on and off when the user 
loads the main page of the program.
